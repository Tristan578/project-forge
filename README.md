An open-source, AI-native 2D/3D game engine for the browser. Every capability — scene creation, materials, physics, scripting, audio, particles, tilemaps, animation, export — is exposed as a JSON command, making the entire editor fully controllable by LLMs and autonomous agents via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Build games by conversation, by code, or by hand.

Powered by WebGPU (with WebGL2 fallback), Rust compiled to WebAssembly, and a React-based visual editor.

## Features

### AI & Automation
- **AI Chat Assistant** — Built-in Claude-powered chat panel with agentic tool loop. Describe what you want in plain language and the AI executes compound actions to spawn entities, configure materials, write scripts, and iterate across multiple turns until the scene is complete. The upcoming Game Creation Orchestrator will decompose any game description into composable systems (movement, camera, challenge, feedback, etc.) and coordinate specialist agents to build them in parallel
- **Compound AI Actions** — 8 high-level tools (`create_scene_from_description`, `setup_character`, `arrange_entities`, etc.) that batch dozens of operations into single AI calls
- **Extended Thinking** — Toggle deep reasoning mode for complex multi-step requests like full game setup
- **Visual Scripting** — React Flow node graph editor with 73 node types across 10 categories. Non-programmers create game logic by connecting visual blocks; graphs compile to TypeScript
- **AI Asset Generation** — Generate 3D models, textures, sound effects, voice lines, and music via 5 provider integrations (Meshy, ElevenLabs, Suno, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- **MCP Server** — 350 commands across 41 categories. Any MCP-compatible agent or LLM can create scenes, configure materials, set up physics, write game scripts, and export finished games — no UI interaction required. See the [MCP command reference](https://docs.spawnforge.ai/mcp) for the full public command listing.
- **Command-Driven Architecture** — Every engine operation is a JSON command through `handle_command()`. The visual editor and AI agents use the exact same API
- **Scene Context** — Built-in context builder provides LLMs with full scene state for informed decision-making
- **Documentation System** — 28+ structured docs searchable via MCP tools (`search_docs`, `get_doc`, `list_doc_topics`), enabling AI agents to learn features on demand

### 3D Engine
- **WebGPU Rendering** — Primary rendering via WebGPU (wgpu 27) with automatic WebGL2 fallback for older browsers

- **Audio** — Spatial 3D audio, bus mixer with effect chains (reverb, delay, EQ, compressor), adaptive music (vertical stem layering), reverb zones, crossfade, ducking
- **GPU Particles** — 9 built-in presets (fire, smoke, sparks, rain, snow, explosions, etc.) with full customization via WebGPU compute shaders
- **Skeletal Animation** — glTF animation playback with transport controls, crossfade, blend weights, per-clip speed, and script API
- **Keyframe Animation** — Custom animation clips with position/rotation/scale/color keyframes, easing modes, and timeline editor
- **CSG Boolean Operations** — Union, subtract, and intersect on mesh entities using BSP-based constructive solid geometry
- **Procedural Terrain** — Heightmap generation with Perlin/Simplex/Value noise, sculpting tools, and vertex coloring
- **Procedural Mesh Generation** — Extrude 2D shapes, lathe profiles, array entities, and combine meshes
- **Polygon Modeling** — Edit mode with vertex/edge/face selection, extrude, subdivide, and normal recalculation
- **Custom Shader Effects** — 6 built-in visual effects (Dissolve, Hologram, Force Field, Lava/Flow, Toon, Fresnel Glow)
- **Custom WGSL Shaders** — Write arbitrary WGSL fragment shader code directly in the editor. 8 built-in templates (Passthrough, Color Tint, Wave Distortion, Rim Light, Grayscale, Pulsing Glow, UV Scroll, Scanlines), real-time compile status, error display, Ctrl+Enter compile shortcut, and scene persistence
- **Post-Processing** — Bloom, chromatic aberration, color grading, CAS sharpening, SSAO (WebGPU), depth of field, and motion blur
- **LOD System** — Level-of-detail component with distance thresholds, performance budget tracking

### 2D Engine

## Architecture

```
MCP Server (350 commands, 41 categories)       AI agents + LLM tool use
    |  JSON commands
React Shell (Next.js 16, Zustand, Tailwind)    Visual editor UI
    |  JSON events via wasm-bindgen
Bevy Engine (Rust -> WebAssembly)              Scene editing + WebGPU rendering
    |
Game Runtime + TypeScript Scripting            In-browser game execution
```

The MCP server and the visual editor share the same command interface — there is no separate "AI mode." An agent calling `set_material` goes through the exact same code path as a user dragging a color picker.

**Rendering:** WebGPU primary (auto-detected), WebGL2 fallback. Two WASM binaries are built per release — the frontend auto-selects the correct one at runtime.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable) with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- [wasm-bindgen-cli](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/cli.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20-24
- Bash (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) for build scripts

### Install the WASM target

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tristan578/project-forge.git
cd project-forge
```

### 2. Build the WASM engine

```bash
# macOS / Linux
./build_wasm.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\build_wasm.ps1

# This compiles both WebGL2 and WebGPU WASM binaries
# and copies them to web/public/
```

<details>
<summary>WASM build troubleshooting</summary>

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `wasm-bindgen` version mismatch | CLI version differs from the `wasm-bindgen` crate in `Cargo.lock` (pinned to 0.2.108) | `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.108` |
| `error[E0433]: could not find crate` | Missing the WASM compile target | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| `doc-image-embed` link errors (Windows) | Native proc-macro needs Windows SDK LIB paths | The build script auto-detects; ensure Visual Studio Build Tools are installed |
| Pink/magenta materials in browser | Missing `tonemapping_luts` Bevy feature | Verify `Cargo.toml` includes `"tonemapping_luts"` in default features |
| `wasm-opt` not found warning | Optional optimization step | `cargo install wasm-opt` (non-fatal — build still succeeds) |
| Engine loads but renders nothing | WebGPU not supported; fallback not triggered | Check browser console for WebGPU detection; try Chrome/Edge with `chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu` |

</details>

### 3. Install web dependencies

```bash
cd web
npm install
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp web/.env.example web/.env.local
# Edit web/.env.local with your API keys (Clerk, Stripe, database, etc.)
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a WebGPU-capable browser (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, or Firefox Nightly).

### 6. Install MCP server dependencies (optional)

```bash
cd ../mcp-server
npm install
```

## Development

### Build commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./build_wasm.sh` | Build both WASM variants — macOS / Linux |
| `.\build_wasm.ps1` | Build both WASM variants — Windows (PowerShell) |
| `cd web && npm run dev` | Start the Next.js dev server |
| `cd web && npm run build` | Production build |
| `cd web && npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `cd web && npx tsc --noEmit` | TypeScript type checking |
| `cd web && npx vitest run` | Run web tests (~14,200+ tests) |
| `cd mcp-server && npx vitest run` | Run MCP server tests |

### Key conventions

- **Bridge isolation:** Only `engine/src/bridge/` may import `web_sys`/`js_sys`/`wasm_bindgen`. The `core/` module is pure Rust with no browser dependencies.
- **Command-driven:** All engine operations are expressed as JSON commands through `handle_command()`. This enables both the UI and programmatic integrations to drive the editor.
- **Event-driven updates:** Bevy systems emit events via the bridge -> JS callback -> Zustand store -> React re-render. No direct DOM manipulation from Rust.

## Agentic Development

SpawnForge is designed for **AI-assisted development**. Six AI coding tools are pre-configured with shared enforcement hooks, skills, and project context. Any contributor can open the repo in their preferred tool and start working immediately — ticket tracking, code quality, and GitHub sync are enforced consistently across all tools.

### Supported Tools

| Tool | Config Dir | Hooks | Skills | Default Model |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|---------------|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) | `.claude/` | Automatic | `.claude/skills/` | Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | `.github/` | Automatic | `.github/skills/` | GitHub-managed |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `.gemini/` | Automatic | `.agents/skills/` | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` |
| [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com) | `.windsurf/` | Automatic | `.windsurf/workflows/` | App-managed |
| [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) | `.agent/` + `.gemini/` | Manual | `.agent/skills/` | Gemini 3 |
| [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `.codex/` | Manual | `.codex/skills/` | `gpt-5.3-codex` |

**First-time setup:** Install the [taskboard binary](https://github.com/tcarac/taskboard/releases), then open the repo in your AI tool. Tools with automatic hooks will self-configure on first session. Tools without hooks (Codex, Antigravity) include manual workflow instructions in their `AGENTS.md` files.

### Quick Start by Tool

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```bash
cd project-forge
claude  # hooks auto-start taskboard, pull GitHub, display backlog
```
Everything is automatic. Hooks enforce ticket-before-code on every prompt, validate tickets after every response, push changes to GitHub, and lint edited files. Skills are invoked via `/kanban`, `/sync-push`, `/sync-pull`, `/planner`, `/builder`, `/cycle`.

Claude Code also has three **subagents** (`.claude/agents/`):
- **Planner** (Opus) — Architect that creates specs in `specs/`, never writes code
- **Builder** (Sonnet) — Implementation specialist, reads specs and writes code
- **Validator** (Sonnet) — QA gatekeeper, runs tests and architecture checks

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong></summary>

```bash
cd project-forge
# Copilot reads .github/hooks/hooks.json and .github/instructions/copilot.instructions.md
```
Hooks trigger on session start (pull), prompt submit (ticket gate), and post-tool-use (validate + push). Skills available in `.github/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. Prompts for manual sync in `.github/prompts/`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
cd project-forge
gemini  # reads .gemini/settings.json, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md
```
Hooks configured in `.gemini/settings.json` for SessionStart, BeforeAgent, AfterAgent, and AfterTool (file edits). Skills in `.agents/skills/`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windsurf</strong></summary>

```bash
cd project-forge
# Windsurf reads .windsurf/hooks.json and .windsurf/rules/taskboard.md
```
Hooks trigger on `post_write_code`, `post_run_command`, `post_cascade_response`, and `pre_user_prompt`. Workflows for sync in `.windsurf/workflows/`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Google Antigravity</strong></summary>

```bash
cd project-forge
# Antigravity reads GEMINI.md (with AGENTS.md loading directive) and .agent/skills/
# No auto-hooks — run manually:
bash .claude/hooks/on-session-start.sh   # start of session
bash .claude/hooks/on-stop.sh             # after work
bash .claude/hooks/post-edit-lint.sh      # after editing
```
Skills in `.agent/skills/` (singular — Antigravity uses `.agent/`, not `.agents/`). Rules in `.agent/rules/`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenAI Codex CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
cd project-forge
codex  # reads .codex/config.toml and .codex/AGENTS.md
# No auto-hooks — run manually:
bash .claude/hooks/on-session-start.sh   # start of session
bash .claude/hooks/on-stop.sh             # after work
bash .claude/hooks/post-edit-lint.sh      # after editing
```
Config in `.codex/config.toml`. Skills in `.codex/skills/`. Full enforcement rules in `.codex/AGENTS.md`.

</details>

### Shared Hook System

All tools call the same bash scripts in `.claude/hooks/`. Tools with hook support wire them up automatically via their config files; tools without hooks require manual execution.

```
Tool Config (JSON/TOML)
    │
    ▼
Shared Bash Scripts (.claude/hooks/)
    │
    ├── taskboard-state.sh      ← Library: API helpers, validation, consistency
    ├── github_project_sync.py  ← Sync engine: push/pull with GitHub Projects v2
    └── github-sync-config.json ← GitHub Project metadata
```

#### Hook Lifecycle

| Hook | Script | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Session Start** | `on-session-start.sh` | Tool opens | Checks taskboard binary, auto-starts server, pulls from GitHub Project, displays backlog with prioritized work suggestions, warns about stale tickets |
| **Prompt Submit** | `on-prompt-submit.sh` | Before each prompt | Detects development-intent keywords, blocks code work if no active ticket, injects active ticket context |
| **Stop** | `on-stop.sh` | After each response | Validates active ticket (user story, AC, priority, team, subtasks), checks open ticket consistency, pushes changes to GitHub Project |
| **Post-Edit Lint** | `post-edit-lint.sh` | After file edits | Runs ESLint on changed `.ts`/`.tsx` files under `web/` (skips tests, node_modules, coverage) |
| **Sync Push** | `sync-to-github.sh` | Called by Stop | Guards for `gh` CLI + auth, calls `github_project_sync.py push` |
| **Sync Pull** | `sync-from-github.sh` | Called by Session Start | Guards for `gh` CLI + auth, calls `github_project_sync.py pull` |

#### Ticket Validation Rules

The `tb_validate_ticket()` function in `taskboard-state.sh` enforces:

1. **User Story** — Must match regex `As an?\s+.+,\s+I want\s+.+\s+so that\s+.+`
2. **Acceptance Criteria** — Minimum 3 complete Given/When/Then scenarios (happy path, edge case, negative)
3. **Description Substance** — At least 20 characters of technical context beyond user story and AC
4. **Priority** — Must be `urgent`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`
5. **Team** — Must be assigned to Engineering, PM, or Leadership
6. **Subtasks** — At least 3 implementation steps

### Skills Reference

Skills are callable capabilities loaded on-demand. Each tool stores them in its own directory, but all reference the same shared hook scripts.

| Skill | Available In | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **kanban** | All 6 tools | View board, create/update/move tickets, validate fields, toggle subtasks. Claude Code uses MCP tools; other tools use REST API (`curl` to `localhost:3010`) |
| **sync-push** | All 6 tools | Push local ticket changes to GitHub Project. Syncs full body (description, priority, subtask checkboxes, metadata block). Detects changes via content hashing |
| **sync-pull** | All 6 tools | Pull GitHub Project changes to local taskboard. Reconstructs subtasks from checkboxes, re-links tickets by ULID from metadata, imports new tickets with parsed fields |
| **planner** | Claude Code | Architect agent — analyzes requests, creates detailed specs in `specs/`, never writes code |
| **builder** | Claude Code | Implementation agent — reads specs, writes Rust/TypeScript, runs lint/check after coding |
| **cycle** | Claude Code | Orchestration — runs Plan → Build → Verify loop, updates project context after each cycle |
| **arch-validator** | Claude Code | Runs `check_arch.py` — 7 structural rules (bridge isolation, file sizes, dispatch chain, store composition) |

### GitHub Project Sync

The `github_project_sync.py` engine provides **bidirectional sync** between the local taskboard and [GitHub Project "SpawnForge" (#2)](https://github.com/orgs/Tristan578/projects/2).

**V2 body format:** Each ticket on GitHub contains a structured body:
```markdown
**Priority:** high

[ticket description — user story, AC, technical context]

## Subtasks
- [ ] Step 1
- [x] Step 2 (completed)
- [ ] Step 3

---
<!-- SPAWNFORGE_METADATA
{ "version": 2, "ticketId": "...", "bodyHash": "...", "subtaskHash": "..." }
SPAWNFORGE_METADATA -->
```

- `- [ ]`/`- [x]` renders as interactive checkboxes on GitHub
- The HTML comment is invisible but machine-parseable for re-linking
- Content hashes detect changes without full comparison
- Old v1 format (`**Taskboard:** PF-N (ULID)`) is still parsed on pull and auto-upgraded to v2 on next push

**Commands:**
```bash
python3 .claude/hooks/github_project_sync.py push       # incremental push
python3 .claude/hooks/github_project_sync.py push-all   # full push (upgrades all to v2)
python3 .claude/hooks/github_project_sync.py pull        # pull remote changes
python3 .claude/hooks/github_project_sync.py status      # show sync state
```

### Architecture Validator

The `check_arch.py` script enforces 7 structural rules:

| Rule | Limit | What It Checks |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Bridge isolation | Hard fail | No `web_sys`/`js_sys`/`wasm_bindgen` imports outside `engine/src/bridge/` |
| Rust file size | 800 lines | No Rust source file exceeds limit |
| TypeScript file size | 500 lines | No TS/TSX file exceeds limit (excludes tests, `.d.ts`, legacy) |
| Command dispatch | 50 match arms | `commands/mod.rs` delegates to domain modules, not monolithic match |
| Pending mod.rs | No request structs | Request types live in domain modules, not `pending/mod.rs` |
| Store composition | 200 lines | `editorStore.ts` composes slices, doesn't define inline state |
| Event delegation | 150 lines | `useEngineEvents.ts` delegates to `hooks/events/` handlers |

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/arch-validator/check_arch.py           # warnings
python3 .claude/skills/arch-validator/check_arch.py --strict   # exit 1 on any violation
python3 .claude/skills/arch-validator/check_arch.py --json     # machine-readable output
```

### Taskboard

All work is tracked on a local [taskboard](https://github.com/tcarac/taskboard) that syncs to GitHub Projects.

**Install:**
```bash
go install github.com/tcarac/taskboard@latest
# Or download from https://github.com/tcarac/taskboard/releases
```

**Start:**
```bash
cd project-forge
taskboard start --port 3010
```

- **Web UI:** http://localhost:3010
- **API:** http://localhost:3010/api
- **Project ID:** `01KK974VMNC16ZAW7MW1NH3T3M` (prefix: PF)
- **Database:** `.claude/taskboard.db` (SQLite, 186+ tickets)

Tools with hook support auto-start the taskboard on session start. The database is committed to the repo so all contributors share the same ticket state.
